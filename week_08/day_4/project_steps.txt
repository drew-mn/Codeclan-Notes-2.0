- Create project folder
- Create server / client
- npm init -y
- Dev Dependencies:
	- npm i -D nodemon webpack webpack-cli mocha
- Dependencies
	- npm i mongodb express body-parser
- Edit package.json, add server:dev, build, maybe seeds to scripts section
- In server/ folder, we create helpers/, db/, server.js file
- (When we run our seeds file, it's mongo < server/db/seeds.js)
- in client/ folder, we create src/, public/.
- Inside src/, we need app.js, models/, helpers/, views/
- Inside public/, we need index.html, css/, js/, images/
- Set up index.html, add a script tag pointing to bundle.js
- create webpack.config.js and wire everything up
- create .gitignore file with node_modules, bundle.js
- git add, git commit, git push

If npm run build fails, we need to use older version of webpack.

- delete node_modules folder
- go into package.json, and change the version to "4.2.0"
- npm install, run build again
